# hds-next

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project which can be used to test Helsinki Design System components.

## Setup

This project assumes that it has been cloned as a sibling to the helsinki-design-sytem project. So your directory structure should be something like this:

```
projects/
├─ helsinki-design-system/
├─ hds-next/
```

## Installing local version of hds

To install your local version of HDS, run:

```bash
yarn hds
```

This command will build, package and install `hds-core`, `hds-design-tokens` and `hds-react` from your local `helsinki-design-system` repository. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
